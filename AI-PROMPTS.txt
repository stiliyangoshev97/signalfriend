PROMPT #1: FULL PROJECT CONTEXT REVIEW (Recommended for new chats)
================================================================================

Please review the SignalFriend project to understand the current state before we continue development. 

First, scan the workspace structure to see what components exist (contracts/, backend/, frontend/, etc.).

Then read and analyze these core documentation files:
1. `/PROJECT.md` - Business model and overall project vision
2. `/TO-DO.txt` - Task list with current progress
3. `/contracts/README.md` - Smart contracts overview (if exists)
4. `/contracts/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Smart contracts technical details (if exists)
5. `/contracts/CHANGELOG.md` - Smart contracts version history (if exists)
6. `/contracts/deployment-addresses.txt` - Deployed contract addresses (if exists)
7. `/backend/README.md` - Backend overview (if exists)
8. `/frontend/README.md` - Frontend overview (if exists)

After reviewing what exists, provide a brief summary of:
- Current project phase and overall status
- Which components exist (contracts, backend, frontend)
- What has been completed in each component
- What is pending/in progress
- Any blockers or issues noted

Then ask me what I'd like to work on next.

================================================================================
PROMPT #2: QUICK STATUS CHECK (For shorter sessions)
================================================================================

Please quickly review the SignalFriend project status:

1. Scan the workspace structure to see what folders/components exist
2. Read `/TO-DO.txt` - Focus on completed vs pending items
3. Read `/PROJECT.md` - Quick overview of the project

Give me a 1-paragraph summary of where we are across all components, then ask what I want to work on.

2. `/TO-DO.txt` - Backend-related tasks
3. `/backend/README.md` - Backend overview (if exists)
4. Scan `/backend/` folder structure (if exists)
5. `/contracts/deployment-addresses.txt` - Contract addresses the backend needs

Summarize the backend architecture, what's implemented, and what's pending. Then ask what backend work I need help with.

================================================================================
PROMPT #5: FRONTEND CONTEXT (React/Viem/Wagmi/RainbowKit)
================================================================================

I'm working on SignalFriend frontend. Please review:

1. `/PROJECT.md` - Overall vision and UX requirements
2. `/TO-DO.txt` - Frontend-related tasks
3. `/frontend/README.md` - Frontend overview (if exists)
4. Scan `/frontend/` folder structure (if exists)
5. `/contracts/deployment-addresses.txt` - Contract addresses for Web3 integration

Summarize the frontend architecture, what's implemented, and what's pending. Then ask what frontend work I need help with.

================================================================================
PROMPT #6: TESTING CONTEXT
================================================================================

I'm working on SignalFriend testing. Please review:

1. `/TO-DO.txt` - Testing tasks and manual test checklist
2. For smart contracts: `/contracts/test/` folder
3. For backend: `/backend/test/` or `/backend/__tests__/` (if exists)
4. For frontend: `/frontend/test/` or component tests (if exists)

Summarize what testing exists across all components and what's pending. Then ask what testing work I need.

================================================================================
PROMPT #7: DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS CONTEXT
================================================================================

I need help with SignalFriend deployment or operations. Please review:

1. `/contracts/RUNBOOK.md` - Smart contracts operations guide (if exists)
2. `/contracts/deployment-addresses.txt` - Current addresses
3. Any deployment scripts in `/contracts/script/`, `/backend/`, `/frontend/`
4. Environment setup files (`.env.example` files)

Summarize deployment status across all components and available operations. Then ask what I need help with.

================================================================================
PROMPT #8: BUG FIX / ISSUE CONTEXT
================================================================================

I'm encountering an issue with SignalFriend. Before I describe it, please:

1. Scan the workspace to understand the project structure
2. Read `/TO-DO.txt` - See current state
3. Read relevant CHANGELOG files - See recent changes
4. Read deployment addresses if it's a deployed contract issue

Then I'll describe the issue and we can troubleshoot together.

================================================================================
PROMPT #9: NEW COMPONENT SETUP
================================================================================

I want to set up a new component for SignalFriend. Please review:

1. `/PROJECT.md` - Understand the overall vision

                    📝 NOTES FOR AI ASSISTANTS
================================================================================

## Project Overview:
SignalFriend is a Web3 signal marketplace on BNB Chain where:
- Predictors sell trading signals as NFTs
- Traders buy signals and receive transferable receipt NFTs
- All payments in USDT, transparent on-chain

## Tech Stack:
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin (BNB Chain)
- **Backend:** Express.js, MongoDB, ethers.js (planned/in-progress)
- **Frontend:** React, Viem, Wagmi, RainbowKit (planned/in-progress)
