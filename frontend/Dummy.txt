# SignalFriend Frontend - Vercel Preview Trigger File
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE:
# This file is used to trigger Vercel preview deployments in a monorepo setup.
# Since SignalFriend uses a monorepo (frontend + backend in same repo), Vercel
# may not always detect changes that require a new preview deployment.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. When you push backend changes to Render and need a corresponding frontend
#    preview to test the full stack together, simply update this file.
# 2. Add a new line below with the preview version (Preview1, Preview2, etc.)
# 3. Commit and push - Vercel will detect the change and create a new preview.
#
# WHEN YOU NEED THIS:
# - Backend API changes that require frontend testing
# - Testing full integration before merging to production
# - When backend is deployed to Render preview but frontend hasn't changed
#
# PREVIEW DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:
# 1. Push backend changes → Render creates preview deployment
# 2. Get Render preview URL (e.g., https://signalfriend-backend-pr-123.onrender.com)
# 3. Update this file with new preview version
# 4. Push to trigger Vercel preview
# 5. In Vercel preview settings, set VITE_API_BASE_URL to Render preview URL
# 6. Test the full stack on both preview environments
# 7. If everything works, merge to main for production deployment
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Each Vercel preview needs its own environment variables configured
# - Set VITE_API_BASE_URL in Vercel preview to point to Render preview backend
# - Production environment variables remain unchanged
