================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS
================================================================================

[✅] FIXED: SignalCard shows "Expired" for all signals (v0.8.1)
    - Location: src/features/signals/components/SignalCard.tsx
    - Problem: getExpiryInfo() was called with createdAt date (always in the past)
    - Solution: Added expiresAt field to backend Signal model
    - Predictors now set expiryDays (1-30) when creating signals
    - SignalCard and SignalDetailPage now use real expiresAt
    - Migration script added for existing signals

[✅] FIXED: Unauthenticated users redirected from signal detail page (v0.9.6)
    - Location: src/features/signals/hooks/usePurchase.ts, src/shared/api/apiClient.ts
    - Problem: Protected API hooks fired before auth store hydrated, causing 401s
    - Solution: Added hasHydrated + hasToken checks to all protected hooks
    - Also updated apiClient to not redirect on 401 for public endpoints

[✅] FIXED: Price input can't enter trailing decimals (v0.9.6)
    - Location: src/features/predictors/components/CreateSignalModal.tsx
    - Problem: type="number" with valueAsNumber strips trailing zeros on each keystroke
    - Solution: Changed to type="text" with inputMode="decimal" + custom validation

[✅] FIXED: SignalCard layout inconsistent (footer at different heights) (v0.9.6)
    - Location: src/features/signals/components/SignalCard.tsx
    - Problem: Variable title lengths and verbose expiry text caused cards to have different heights
    - Solution: Added h-full + mt-auto, min-h on title, abbreviated expiry format (e.g., "Expires in 8h")

[✅] FIXED: Predictor sales not showing on signal detail page (v0.12.1)
    - Location: Backend signal.service.ts + frontend PredictorInfoCard.tsx
    - Problem: Signal detail API only populated minimal predictor fields (missing totalSales, totalReviews, bio, isVerified)
    - Solution: Backend now populates all PredictorInfoCard fields; frontend uses totalSales with fallback

[✅] FIXED: Stale data shown after wallet switch (v0.1.2)
    - Location: src/features/auth/api/authHooks.ts (useSessionSync)
    - Problem: When user switched wallets, they were logged out but stayed on current page with stale data
    - Example: Predictor profile showed "Purchased" badges for signals bought by OLD wallet
    - Solution: useSessionSync now redirects to home page on wallet change via router.navigate('/')
    - User must sign in again with new wallet to get fresh data

[✅] FIXED: 401 error when visiting predictor profile with connected but unsigned wallet (v0.1.3)
    - Location: src/features/predictors/pages/PredictorProfilePage.tsx
    - Problem: useMyPurchasedContentIds hook was enabled when wallet was connected (not signed in)
    - Root cause: Hook checked !!connectedWallet but API requires SIWE authentication
    - Solution: Changed to check isAuthenticated from useAuthStore instead of wallet connection
    - Also improved useSessionSync to only track addresses when authenticated

[✅] FIXED: Rating submission doesn't update UI without page refresh (v0.1.4)
    - Location: src/features/signals/hooks/useReviews.ts
    - Problem: After rating a signal, predictor profile and signal detail didn't show updated rating
    - Root cause: Only review-specific queries were invalidated, not signal/predictor queries
    - Solution: useCreateReview now invalidates signal detail, predictor profile, and signal lists

[✅] FIXED: Purchase not reflected in UI when API rate-limited (v0.1.4)
    - Location: src/features/signals/hooks/usePurchase.ts
    - Problem: Blockchain transaction succeeded but UI didn't update due to API rate limiting
    - Root cause: Cache invalidation happened immediately, but webhook might not have processed yet
    - Solution: Added multiple delayed cache invalidations (2s, 5s, 10s) after purchase confirmation
    - Test: Use scripts/trigger-rate-limit.sh to simulate rate limiting during purchase

================================================================================
