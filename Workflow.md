Each tech (frontend, backend, foundry, etc..) must have: readme.md, to-do-backend/frontend/foundry.md, runbook.md, project_context.md file. Project_context.me is about the current state of the project, changelog.md is for the changes, runbook.md is about important commands/tasks we use to test or make the project work. 
Everytime we work on a different feature and/or we need to write/modify code, I want you to create a new branch
Everytime we change the code or write new code, the changelog.md, project_context.md, to-do.txt must be updated.
After we have finished working on a branch, commit with a good description and push. Ill then create a pr from github website and merge. Then ill delete the branch on githuh website and let you know when the merge is completed so you can go back to main branch, pull the changes and delete locally unused branches (prunk).

Important: only modify the project_context, readme.md, changelog.md, to-do.txt of the techs we are working on (frontend, backend, etc..) 

Additionally we have a PROJECT.md which describes the use of the full app we are building. If we introduce new things or decide to not use something, we should reflect it there, but keep in mind thats a not-technical file, its mostly the roadmap for the app, includes technologies needed and logic, decisions about the app.
