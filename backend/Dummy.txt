# SignalFriend Backend - Render Deployment Trigger File
# ============================================================================
# 
# PURPOSE:
# This file is used to trigger Render deployments in a monorepo setup.
# Since SignalFriend uses a monorepo (frontend + backend in same repo), Render
# may not always detect changes that require a new deployment, especially when
# only frontend changes are made but you need to verify backend connectivity.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. When you push frontend changes to Vercel and need a corresponding backend
#    deployment to test the full stack together, simply update this file.
# 2. Add a new entry below with the date and reason for the trigger.
# 3. Commit and push to trigger Render's auto-deploy.
#
# WHY THIS FILE?
# - Render watches the /backend folder for changes
# - When testing frontend + backend integration, both need fresh deploys
# - This avoids making unnecessary code changes just to trigger a deployment
# - Acts as a deployment log for tracking when manual triggers were needed
#
# ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
# - Use Render Dashboard to manually trigger "Manual Deploy"
# - Make a real change to any backend file
# - Use deploy hooks (requires Render paid plan features)
